<p align="left">RESTRICTIONS OF LIABILITY REGARDING CUSTOMERS IN GERMANY</p>
<p align="left">Corel is liable for damages based on an intentional or  grossly negligent breach of duty or malice by Corel, its legal representatives  or persons whom it uses to perform its obligations. Insofar as Corel is liable  for malice pursuant to sentence 1, compensation for damages of commercial customers  is limited to the foreseeable, typically arising damages.</p>
<p align="left">Further, Corel is also liable for damages that are caused  by simple negligence if the negligence concerns the breach of such contractual  obligations the fulfillment of which is of particular importance to achieving  the purpose of the contract and in which You may therefore regularly trust  (cardinal obligation; <em>Kardinalpflicht</em>).  In this case, liability is limited to the foreseeable, typically arising  damages.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, Corel has unlimited liability for damage to  life, limb, and health for which it is responsible, which are caused by  negligent or intentional breach of duty. Corel also assumes liability to the  extent it has provided a guaranty as to quality or durability within the  context of this guarantee.</p>
<p align="left">Further contractual or statutory liability is – to the  extent legally permitted – excluded without regard to the legal status of the  claim asserted.</p>
<p align="left">Where Corel’s liability is excluded or limited, this also  applies to the personal liability of its employees, representatives and persons  whom it uses to perform its obligations as well as Corel’s responsibility for  their behavior.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>U.S.  GOVERNMENT-RESTRICTED RIGHTS.</strong> The Software and any  accompanying documentation are “commercial computer software” and “commercial  computer software documentation,” under DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section  12.212.

No term or provision  in this EULA will be considered waived, and no breach excused, unless such  waiver is in writing signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is  asserted. No waiver (whether express or implied) will constitute consent to,  waiver of, or excuse of any other, different, or subsequent breach. No  modifications or amendments to this EULA will be binding upon Corel unless made  in writing and duly executed by You and an authorized representative of Corel.</p>
